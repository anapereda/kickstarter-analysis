# An Analysis of kicstarter campaign

In this analysis we are helping Louse launch a Kickstarter campaign based on the data of Kickstarter campaigns.

We first calculated the percentage fun of the campaign, and average donation. The new columns are included in the Excel document. We divided categories and subcategories to further explore the specific characteristics applicaple to client campaign. 

This bar graph shows the distribution of campaing by parent category. The biggest number of campaigs is registere under the "Theater" parent category; there is a similar distribution of success, failed and cancelled in all categories.

##Summary statistics
To set a successfull $ goal; we took a look of the median, mean, standard deviantion and interquartile range of the goal and pledged money of both successfull and failed campaigns in the US. Mean and median goal of successful plays were $5,049 and $3,000; whiles mean and median goals of failed campaigns were $10,554 and $5,000. Thus Louse should aim to make her campaign between $3,000 and $5,000; half of her initial campaign budget.

We conclude that in order to make a successful play Louise whould make her campaign for less than $5,000; probably around $3,000 and should be launched in June or July to maximize the chance of success.
